# Cyphomancer-Agents-Bot

Telegram Custom AI Agent Launching Bot for Cyphomancer

---

## My Telegram Bot

This repository contains a simple Telegram bot using [Telethon](https://pypi.org/project/Telethon/).

### Usage

- Start the bot in Telegram by sending `/start`.
- Use inline buttons to create or edit AI agents.

### Security & Privacy

- Make sure you **never commit** your `.env` file to GitHub, as it contains sensitive information.
- **Account Linking Notice**: By linking Telegram accounts to this bot, you grant the bot and its admins access to those accounts. **Only link Telegram accounts that do not have access to funds or trading bots**, if applicable. Do not link personal or sensitive accounts that you do not wish to share.

### Customization

Replace the `[LLM placeholder]` function in your code with actual logic that calls your VPS or locally hosted LLM endpoint.
